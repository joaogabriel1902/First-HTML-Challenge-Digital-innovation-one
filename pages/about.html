    <h2><strong>What is HTML?</strong></h2>
    <small><a href=#begin>(voltar)</small></a>

    <p>To understand "<strong> HTML</strong>" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the
        abbreviation:

    <ul>
        <li> <b> Hypertext:</b> text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect
            related items
        </li>

        <li> <b> Markup:</b> a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format</li>

        <li> <b>Language:</b> a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and
        interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add
        interactivity, respectively.

        In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like
        a human body.

    <p>HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the help
        of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three
        main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.

    <p>When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are
        used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.

        An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can differentiate between a simple text and HTML
        text. You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.

    <p> All HTML tags must enclosed within <> these brackets.
            Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.
            If you have used an open tag <tag>, then you must use a close tag </tag> (except some tags)</p>

    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <small><a href=#inicio>(back)</a></small>

    <p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many
        different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which
        became an official standard in December 1999.</p>

    <p> Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that
        is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML
        (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these
        languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across
        applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create
        an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated
        in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML
        languages, because without it, interoperability between applications would be impossible. You'll learn
        more about the differences between HTML and XHTML in Unit 2.</p>

    <p> Most pages on the Web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0. However, in recent years,
        the W3C (in collaboration with another organization, the WHATWG), has been working on a brand new
        version of HTML, HTML5. Currently (2011), HTML5 is still a draft specification, and is not yet an
        official standard. However, it is already widely supported by browsers and other web-enabled devices,
        and is the way of the future. Therefore, HTML5 is the primary language taught in this course.</p>
